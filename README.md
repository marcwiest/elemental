# Elemental CSS
Elemental CSS covers the base for most HTML elements and resets most styles similarly to [Tailwind's Preflight CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight/). The `<html>` tag has a minimum width of 320 pixel (see `_document.scss`). [NormalizeCSS](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is also included by default.
