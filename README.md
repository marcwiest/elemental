# Elemental CSS
Elemental CSS covers the base for most HTML elements and only creates a couple of class names (i.e. `.h1` to `.h6` and `.small`). The `<html>` tag has a minimum width of 320 pixel (see `_document.scss`). [NormalizeCSS](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is also included by default.
