# Elemental CSS
Elemental CSS covers the basics for most HTML elements and resets most styles similarly to [Tailwind's Preflight CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight/). The `<html>` tag has a minimum width of 320 pixel and the `:root` font size is set to 62.5% to allow for easier `rem` conversion (e.g. 1.6rem = 16px). [NormalizeCSS](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is also included by default.
